# Bezier Curve python drawer

This repository contains a few programs by ALN and Harrison for our Calculus project.

All of these programs allow you to draw and visualize bezier curves.

To run bezierRewrite.py (which only has draggable points 1 bezier segment) you will need pygame

run this in your terminal to download pygame:
```pip install pygame```
